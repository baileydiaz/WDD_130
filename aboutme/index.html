    <h2>Bailes</h2>
    <p>Right now I am pursuing a degreee in Computer Science with the goal to become a Software Engineer. 
    Honestly, I am taking this class becuase it is required.  Though, it could be a potential career, who knows!
    The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is that I feel comfortable and feel able to conquer any challenge with all the resources I have.  I am currently pursuing a Bacherlors degree!</p>
    I think professionaly it will be vital to learn the front end of development, I am really excited to get a few new languages under my belt as well.</p>


    <p>I love to spend time with my wife, play basketball, run, and lift. 
    I currently work an online university, I am working there simply to raise funds for the full year of school that I plan on doing here in a little.
    I have been a member since I was 8 years old.  I was very blessed and lucky to be raise by my wodnerful parents who were members already
    One of my favorite quotes is from Elder Eyring "Try, try, try." </p>
