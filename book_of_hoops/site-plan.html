        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I have been a huge fan of sports ever since I was 16 and thoroughly enjoy the competitive nature.  However, I have found that my sources come from so many different avenues and I have to seek them out.  This site is here to personally curate a flow of content that includes verified sources for your favorite teams, highlights, league news, and the latest stats.  Sometimes I see videos about football which I don’t really care about my. I wanted to create a website that has all the sports info specifically catered to the individual, so I did!  The one-stop place for all sports media/highlights/ and news for your favorite teams and leagues.  No more having to select your favorite teams, our algorithms will predict what you want to see before you even see it!  Now, who do you know that would be willing to fund One Stop Sports? </p>  <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>I hope that everyone who loves basetball will use this site.  I especially want to have the younger generation use this site to compare stats especially.  Young basketball fans are the target demographic here however we would also love to see older NBA enthusiasts reminsice on childhood games by looking at older stats and highlights from classic games.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

            The coming fourth of the Book of Hoops
            Sports have enthralled mankind for millennia, the sheer thrill of seeing might against might have no equal.  Now, billions of people all across the globe seek that seem thrill now.  However, things have changed over the years….  Now we have countless hours of sports to analyze and watch.  Statistics of players' performance are now watched diligently by the analytical eye. Sports fanatics need a platform that specifically speaks to them, one where they can see all the newest trade rumors, updated performance analysis, dazzling highlights, and an exciting new stats comparison platform.  
            
            
                                                                     Our Story
            As a teenager, I began to be instantly interested in the National Basketball Association.  Stephen Curry was destroying opposing offenses with his insane ball handling and unprecedented shooting ability.  My friends and I began to have lively debates on which player was better than the other, and my passion continued to grow. We would watch analytical videos, play video games, and play on the blacktop to satiate our obsession.

        <h3>Stats</h3>
        <p>
            Unparalleled Comparison
            When I was younger, my friends would pit two players against one another and debate with stats.  They tell no lies, right?!  However, we got this vital information from websites that were truly boring and uninspired. They gave you exactly what you wanted, but nothing else.  And man it was tough reading through all the lines of stats!  They did the job simply, but…here we also give the people what they want.  With a direct stat comparison tool, you can pull up Kobe and Jordan’s best playoff runs to compare the greats.  Now, we hope to provide a tool for those young and old to live to watch a late-night doubleheader and argue about whom the true G.O.A.T is.  A tool that will provide those who want all thing's basketball.  No more needing to sift through lines of data while your eyes are being burned on the white state page, we got you.
